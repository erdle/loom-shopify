Introduction
------------

We’ve drafted these Terms of Service (which we call the “Terms”) so you’ll know the rules that govern our relationship with you. Although we have tried our best to strip the legalese from the Terms, there are places where these Terms may still read like a traditional contract. There’s a good reason for that: These Terms do indeed form a legally binding contract between you and viaGlamour Ltd. So please read them carefully and know that viaGlamour's support team is always available to help answer your questions.

By using viaGlamour or viaGlamour's apps or any of our other products or services that link to these Terms (we refer to these collectively as the “Services”), you agree to the Terms. Of course, if you don’t agree with them, then don’t use the Services.

viaGlamour’s service (the “viaGlamour Service”) is located at viaGlamour.com and is operated by viaGlamour Ltd. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “viaGlamour”). The viaGlamour Service provides sellers (the “Shop Owners”) with the ability to create and sell cosmetics, merchandise, and beauty products (collectively, “Campaigns”) and buyers with the ability to find and purchase products. Campaigns may be sold on private-label stores hosted on viaGlamour, third-party sites, or retail locations (collectively, “Storefronts”) without notice to the buyers that the products included in the Campaign that are being purchased have or will include viaGlamour's involvement. We offer the viaGlamour Service subject to the following Terms of Service, specifically including viaGlamour’s Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, you are not authorized to use the viaGlamour Service including any. To note, these Terms of Service apply to all of our products and services.

The company, partners, and all parties involved can not guarantee that the discounts can be redeemed by each customer or the duration of the promotion it lasts for. All partners involved are not liable for any damages or false advertising if the product being promoted cannot be purchased or doesn't meet the promotion advertised by partners. Every purchase made for an affiliate product is made at the user's own risk. viaGlamour Ltd. and all of the involved parties such as LogoCore cannot provide any guarantees that the affiliate promotions will work as described.

You access and use any linked website on your own risk.

Information on the Site
-----------------------

You must not treat information on the Site as comprehensive. Any forward-looking statements made on viaGlamour's site are based on our best judgment but are subject to a number of uncertainties as well as events beyond viaGlamour's or their affiliate partners' control. You use the information on your own risk and viaGlamour requests you never to rely on the information (or any part thereof) without first taking appropriate professional advice.

Quality of Artwork and Promotions
---------------------------------

Each campaign must meet reasonable production standards (e.g. a campaign may not include a low quality image that will not print well). All of your advertisements or promotional descriptions, including content that is uploaded to the viaGlamour Service, must be accurate and correct and must not include any content concerning non-viaGlamour activities, events, products, services or promotions.

You represent and warrant that any campaign you create that implicitly or explicitly relates to a charity or fundraising effort is authorized by such charity or fundraising effort, and you will ensure that your campaign description clearly and accurately states the percentage of proceeds that will be donated and to whom those proceeds will be donated.

Distribution
------------

You agree and fully acknowledge that viaGlamour only provides a software logstics service to fulfill orders for existing products sourced from other cosmetics manufacturers. Products fulfilled by the Service are always supplied by third-parties without notice, warning, or disclosure about their origin or original manufacturer. The Service should be treated as an affiliate with zero liability over the product being forwarded through our service from the original manufacturer to the end customer. It should not be treated as an original manufacturer or distrubutor.

Regulations
------------

The service relies on several third-party manufacturers for products and the information provided to the service about their products are not further audited by viaGlamour. All knowledge, certifications, claims, information, ingredients, and other public-facing information are provided to Service by third-party manufacturers such as Jordane Cosmetics or subsidiaries Nature's Own Cosmetics and can be changed regularly without notice to the Service or audits by the Service. The Service should be considered to be an affiliate where they further promote the original manufacturer product without being involved in the original product manufacturing cycle, ingredients selection, formulation, regulatory restrictions, labelling, manufacturing concerns, or distribution of information about the products made available to the Service as an affiliate partner. Information provided about shipping, restrictions, formulation, shipping restrictions, labeling, ingredients, or other policies are provided to the Service on a non-regular basis and the Service does not attempt to further validate or audit the original source of information. The Service, in good faith, relies on Canadian manufactures like Jordane Cosmetics for products and uses their provided information to grow the Service through affiliate and subscription sales to customers. We rely on authoritive enties like Health Canada to audit the manufacturing practices of the Service's partners but no additional verification work is conducted by the Service and thus no guarentees can be passed to any customer. For example, if the Service's partner indicates that a product is 'cruelty-free' those labels will be reused by the Service without the pursuit of verification from auditors and thus the Service assumes zero liability for the change of information, spec, or scope of the products or services involved in the Service. Information providedd or shown by the Service is subject to change at any time without direct notice. Any products shipped to the EU are under the assumption of being commercial samples for merchants. Any person or persons using the Service is responsible for their own registration through the cosmetic product notification portal or other regulation body and must provide the CPMP labels to the Service prior to accepting customer orders. Any orders recieved prior to being provided CPMP are considered to be sample orders that are not intended to be on the market, resale, available for sale, distribution, reshipment, carrier forwarding, auditing, marketing, or any other action conducted on the product after it has been originally received as a sample product.
