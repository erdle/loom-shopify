Introduction

Welcome to viaGlamour! viaGlamour Ltd, "viaGlamour", is a global company offering an internet-based service (the “viaGlamour Service”) that allows campaign creators (“sellers”) to design certain products and promote the sale of those products to consumers (“buyers”) around the world through individual campaigns. This Privacy Policy applies to the viaGlamour Service, operated by viaGlamour, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “viaGlamour”), and located at viaGlamour.com (and other regional URLs).

This Privacy Policy describes how viaGlamour collects and uses the information we obtain when you use the viaGlamour Service. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and manage that information. This Privacy Policy is part of and is governed by our Terms of Service, which you accept in order to transact with us. Your acceptance of this Privacy Policy includes your consent to our use of cookies and other similar technologies as described in this document.

To note, our site may include links to other web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of viaGlamour.

We are not responsible for the policies or practices of any third party website or service.

Information We Collect
----------------------

Information You Provide to Us

“Personal Information” means information that alone or in combination with other information may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you. The Personal Information we collect will be different depending on your activities on the viaGlamour Service. For example, to register as a seller on our service, we will collect your name and email address. If you register using a sign-in service or a social media platform such as Facebook, we will collect the information needed to authenticate your account and any other information the platform provides in that process. If you launch a successful campaign, we may collect additional Personal Information as needed to send you and the applicable tax authorities an income tax reporting statement. If you make a purchase through the viaGlamour Service, we will collect your name, email address, shipping address and payment information such as credit card number and billing address. We may also collect Personal Information you provide about other people, such as their name and physical address (for example, when we ship a gift at your request). This Personal Information is used for the sole purpose of completing your request.

Automated Technologies

“Site Information” means information received and recorded on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, browser type, the date and time of the use, the pages you visit, the page you came from and go to when leaving the viaGlamour Service, your operating system and information about your mobile device. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. In addition, we also automatically collect Site Information when you access or use the viaGlamour Service. We (and our vendors) collect that information using cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, embedded web links, and similar technologies. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our service may be limited. We viaGlamour and our partners use technologies such as cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We also use cookies for our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g. language preference), for authentication and other similar services. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our service may be limited.

viaGlamour Tools

“Performance Information” means information we collect through certain tools that we provide to our sellers. Where a seller requests the use of a particular tool (e.g. an advertising analytics tool for use with ad platforms), then viaGlamour will collect additional data based on the operation of that tool (e.g. advertising conversion information from the applicable ad platform).

viaGlamour Apps

viaGlamour Service includes free tools that include DispatchCore. All files you upload to DispatchCore are kept forever unless notified by email by the original uploader to delete those photos.

Blog

The viaGlamour Service may offer publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at hey@viaGlamour.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

Information Sharing
-------------------

We will share information we collect, including your Personal Information, as needed to provide the viaGlamour Service to you. We will also share your Personal Information with your permission. Otherwise, we do not rent, sell or share your Personal Information with third parties and specifically will not share your Personal Information for their direct marketing purposes without your consent.

Sellers

We may share aggregate, anonymized Site Information, Performance Information or other information with our sellers to help them improve their performance through the viaGlamour Services. We will not share Personal Information with our sellers without your express consent.

Strategic Partners

We may share aggregate, anonymized data with certain marketing and content licensing partners. Where a partner or agency compensates sellers directly, we will also share performance data with the partner to enable those payments. For example, every page view on viaGlamour is anonymized and sent to partners like Snapchat through services like Snapchat Pixel. These services can not be opt-out from viaGlamour unless the original company, like Snapchat, is contacted by the vendor, merchant, or user of the Service.

Vendors and Service Providers

To provide you with the viaGlamour Service, we share information, including Personal Information, with third party vendors and service providers. For example, we provide Personal Information to companies that help us with our business activities, such as marketing, payment processing and fulfillment. We will use reasonable efforts to ensure those companies use your Personal Information only as necessary.

As Required by Law and Similar Disclosures

In certain situations, viaGlamour may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including meeting law enforcement requirements. We may access, preserve, and disclose your Personal Information and content if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to comply with law enforcement requests, such as a court order or subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings, or similar legal process or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or the rights of others. Specifically, we may disclose your information to a complainant who alleges that your activities have violated their rights or policies (e.g. where your campaign or advertisement is the subject of an investigation). We may also disclose your information where you have alleged violation of your rights by another party.
